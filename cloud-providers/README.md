Cloud Providers 
===========================

The application journey to the cloud starts with either provisioning infrastructure or registering already running machines. HyperForm delivers automated, self-service provisioning of VMs on private clouds like HyperCloud, VMware vSphere, OpenStack, and Hyper-V as well as public clouds like Microsoft Azure, AWS, Rackspace, DigitalOcean, IBM SoftLayer, and many others.

##   Create A Cloud Provider
Once logged into HyperForm, you can then register a Cloud Provider. The governance framework in HyperCloud provides role-based access controls, entitlements, approval, quota and cost metering policies to enable secure and holistic management of resources, workloads, and operations across any cloud with the cost visibility needed to control spending. These controls can be configured in the “Cloud Provider” that is registered by IT.

Here's a list of examples for some popular clouds & virtualization platforms.
