HyperForm Documentation 
===========================

HyperForm is the cloud management and application deployment automation engine in HyperCloud, a full-stack cloud service for the enterprise on-premises. HyperCloud combines the agility, simplicity and economics of public cloud services with the customization, control and security of on-premises solutions. 

HyperForm delivers automated, self-service infrastructure and application provisioning on HyperGrid as well as 15 other clouds and virtualization platforms – like VMware vSphere, OpenStack, Microsoft Hyper-V, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and others. The governance framework in HyperForm provides role-based access controls, entitlements, approval, quota and cost metering policies to enable secure and holistic management of resources, workloads, and operations across any cloud with the cost visibility needed to control spending.

HyperForm drives business innovation by modernizing existing legacy applications without making a single code change and using the existing skill sets within an organization. The on-the-fly containerization capabilities allow users to “lift and shift” existing Java and .NET applications to containers while taking care of the complex application dependencies, automatic service discovery, auto-scaling and integration with any external service (e.g. storage, networking, logging, etc.). HyperForm transforms non-cloud-native legacy applications into completely portable applications that can be deployed on any cloud.


This documentation library contains all the instructions for registering cloud providers, provisioning virtual machines, and deploying applications on containers or VMs.
