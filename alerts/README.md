Alerts & Notifications
===========================

Alerts and notifications are available for when containers or VMs are down or when the CPU, Memory or Disk Utilization of either hosts or containers exceed a defined threshold.

Notifications can be accessed by clicking on the Notification bell icon on the top right corner. A user can drill down into notifications to access more information about the incident and how it can be resolved.

Email alerts are sent when a notification is not read within 5 minutes. To set up email alerts, make sure that you configure the SMTP connection details at installation time. If you're using HyperForm SaaS - then alerts will be sent out to the email address registered in the platform.
