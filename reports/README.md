Reports 
===========================

A Tenant Admin can generate reports to track the usage and cost of VMs and applications. Showback reports allow IT organizations to track cloud usage and cost across any cloud environment. Cohesive utilization and cost monitoring means IT organizations can see where to optimize for better cost efficiency. The governance framework automatically enforces policies and quotas that prevent the underutilization of resources.

To create a report, a Tenant Admin can navigate to Reports and then select one of the available options:
-   **Blueprint Usage Report** - summarizes the application blueprints consumed over a selected period of time with inforamtion about the blueprint requestor, the status of the application, the cluster on which the application is deployed, and the date the blueprint was requested.
-   **Cluster Usage Report** - summarizes the clusters consumed over a selected period of time with inforamtion about the blueprint requestor, the status of the application, the cluster on which the application is deployed, and the date the blueprint was requested.
-   **Cloud Usage Report** - summarizes the virtual machines consumed on selected cloud providers and over a selected period of time with inforamtion about the machine blueprint requestor, the name and status of the virtual machine, the number of hours the machine has been running and the total cost of the machine.
