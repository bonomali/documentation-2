HyperCloud Block Storage Service 
===========================

HyperCloud's Block Storage Service (HBS) is one of the core cloud services offered in HyperCloud, a full-stack cloud service for the enterprise on-premises. It combines the agility, simplicity and economics of public cloud services with the customization, control and security of on-premises solutions. HyperCloud provides powerful capabilities to simplify, automate and seamlessly scale application delivery for the enterprise.

The Docker Volume Plugin for HyperCloud's Block Storage Service (HBS) enables automated provisioning and mounting of high performance block devices (for Linux and Windows) to provide persistent storage for containers. Here are the key benefits of HBS:
-   **High performance & fault tolerance.** High performance storage that provides fault tolerance to deliver high availability with fast performance across the data network.
-   **Policy-based Governance.** Leverage HyperCloud's governance framework to enable role-based access controls, entitlements, approval, quota and cost metering policies to manage block storage usage across the enterprise with the cost visibility needed to control spending.  
-   **Rapid block storage delivery.** Self-provisioning of block storage for system administrators means VMs and containers with dedicated, persistent storage volumes are delivered in minutes under the governance policies and security controls defined by IT
-   **QoS controls.** For the mission critical applications, QoS controls on HyperCloud’s all-flash storage were configured to prioritize I/O and provide the expected service levels 
-   **All-flash advantage.** Reducing costs by making maximum use of available storage space with all-flash’s smaller footprint.
-   **Inline erasure encoding.** Protecting the data before it leaves the host and eliminating the need for replicas.
-   **Linear scaling and pricing.** Adding capacity as needed with pay-as-you-go pricing.
