Docker Compose v2
===========================

HyperForm is fully compatible with Docker Compose v2 (https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/).

The platform however provides core (optional) enhancements to Docker Compose supporting advanced plug-ins with lifecycle stages to handle service discovery use cases. It also supports cross-image environment variable bindings, and automatic container IP retrieval and injection.

You can refer to the [Docker Compose v1](https://github.com/hypergrid-inc/documentation/edit/master/library/docker-compose-v1) documentation for examples on how to use plug-ins and data injection.
