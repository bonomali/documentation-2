Self-Service Library 
===========================

The self-service library enables self-provisioning of infrastructure, storage, network, application, and container services in minutes, not days! Even more essential for companies in highly regulated industries, all provisioning workflows initiated through the self-service library adhere to IT-defined governance controls, entitlements, approvals and quota policies â€“ allowing IT to be in full control while providing agility and flexibility to application development teams.

The library page also allows users to create (or author) their own service blueprints. Here are the different blueprints that can be created by clicking on the **Create New Blueprint** button.
-   [**Docker Compose v1**](https://github.com/hypergrid-inc/documentation/tree/master/library/docker-compose-v1) - for creating **Container Services**
-   [**Docker Compose v2**](https://github.com/hypergrid-inc/documentation/tree/master/library/docker-compose-v2/) - for creating **Container Services**
-   [**Machine Compose**](https://github.com/hypergrid-inc/documentation/tree/master/library/machine-compose) - for creating **Compute Services**
-   [**Volume Compose**](https://github.com/hypergrid-inc/documentation/tree/master/library/volume-compose) - for creating **Block Storage Services**
-   [**Network Compose**](https://github.com/hypergrid-inc/documentation/tree/master/library/network-compose) - for creating **Network Services**
